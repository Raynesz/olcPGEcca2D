# olcPGEcca2D
Cyclic Cellular Automaton 2D ported to C++, running on the olc::PixelGameEngine.

There are 2 different .cpp files for the 2 different methods I used to implement the two color-state arrays.
Once you open your solution, add one of the two .cpp (whichever you prefer) in your source files.

The active rule can be changed by modifying the relevant constants defined at the top of the .cpp file.
